Look at you, as fragile as a flower. Still a little sapling, just a sprout
You know why we stay up in this tower. I know, but-
That's right, to keep you safe and sound dear
Guess I always knew this day was coming. Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest
Soon, but not yet. Shh! Trust me, pet. Mother knows best
Mother knows best, listen to your mother, it's a scary world out there
Mother knows best, one way or another, something will go wrong I swear
Ruffians, thug, poison ivy, quicksand, cannibals and snakes, The plague No! Yes!
Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth and stop no more you just upset me.
Mother's right here, Mother will protect you.
Darling, here's what I suggest. Skip the drama, stay with mama. Mother knows best
Go ahead, get trampled by a rhino. Go ahead, get mugged and left for dead
Me, I'm just your mother, what do I know? I only bathed and changed and nursed you
Go ahead and leave me, I deserve it. Let me die alone here, be my guest
When it's too late, you'll see, just wait. Mother knows best
Mother knows best, take it from your muumsy. On your own, you won't survive
Sloppy, underdressed, immature, clumsy. Please, they'll eat you up alive
Gullible, naive, positively grubby. Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm, vague
Plus, I believe, getting kinda chubby. I'm just saying cause I wuv you
Mother understands, Mother's here to help you. All I have is one request
